<h1>Union of Two Sorted Arrays</h1>

<p>Given two sorted arrays <code>nums1</code> and <code>nums2</code>, return an array that contains the <strong>union</strong> of these two arrays. The elements in the union must be in <strong>ascending order</strong>.</p>

<p>The union of two arrays is an array where all values are <strong>distinct</strong> and are present in either the first array, the second array, or both.</p>

<h2>Examples:</h2>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], nums2 = [1, 2, 7]
<strong>Output:</strong> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The elements 1, 2 are common to both, 3, 4, 5 are from nums1 and 7 is from nums2
</pre>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> nums1 = [3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 9], nums2 = [1, 5, 7, 8, 8]
<strong>Output:</strong> [1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The element 7 is common to both, 3, 4, 6, 9 are from nums1 and 1, 5, 8 is from nums2
</pre>
