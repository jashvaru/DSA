/*
 * Logic
 * ->Divide (Partitioning)
 *  -Select a 'pivot' element from the array. The choice of pivot can vary; common strategies 
 *  include picking the first element, the last element, the middle element, or a random element.
 *  -Rearrange the array so that elements less than the pivot are positioned to its left, and 
 *  elements greater than the pivot are positioned to its right. This step is known as partitioning.    
 * ->Conquer (Recursive Sorting)  
 *  -Recursively apply the same process to the sub-arrays formed by partitioning:
 *      -Sort the sub-array of elements less than the pivot.
 *      -Sort the sub-array of elements greater than the pivot.
 * ->Combine
 *  -Since the partitioning step ensures that the pivot is already in its correct position, 
 *  no further work is needed to combine the sub-arrays. The array is sorted once all sub-arrays 
 *  have been processed.
 * 
 * Time Complexity
 * Each level of recursion splits the array into two halves, 
 * leading to a recursion depth of logâ‚‚(n). Each level performs O(n) operations to sort.
 * 
 * hence O(n log2(n))
 * Worst case - O(n log2(n))
 * Avg case - O(n log2(n))
 * Best case - O(n log2(n))
 * 
 * Space Complexity
 * Since we are not using extra variable 
 * O(1)
 * If we consider stack space for recursion
 * O(n)
