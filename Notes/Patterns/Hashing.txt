-What is Hashing?
Hashing is a technique in programming to map data to a fixed-size storage (index) using a function called a hash function.

-In simple words:
You take a piece of data (like a number or string).
Apply a hash function.
Get a hash value (usually an integer index).
Store/retrieve data using that index.
This makes searching and accessing data very fast (O(1) average).

-Analogy
Think of a classroom with 100 lockers.
Each student is assigned a locker based on their roll number.
Instead of searching all lockers, you go directly to the locker number = roll number.
That’s what hashing does: direct access instead of searching.

-Real Use Cases of Hashing
HashMap / HashSet (Java) → Store key-value pairs or unique values with O(1) lookup.
Counting frequencies (e.g., character count in strings).
Detect duplicates quickly.
Password security → cryptographic hashing (MD5, SHA).
Compilers / Databases → symbol tables, indexing.

So, hashing = using a formula to store & access data quickly.
