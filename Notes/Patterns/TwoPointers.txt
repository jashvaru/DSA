-What is the Two Pointers Pattern?
The two pointers pattern is a common coding technique where you use two variables (pointers) to traverse an array, string, or linked list â€” often from different directions (start & end) or with different speeds.
Instead of brute force (using nested loops), it allows you to solve problems more efficiently (usually in O(n) time).

-How It Works
You set up two indexes (pointers):
One starting at the beginning.
One starting at the end (or sometimes both start from the beginning).

Then you move the pointers based on conditions, shrinking or expanding the range until the problem is solved.
