-What is Moore’s Voting Algorithm?
It’s an algorithm to find the majority element in an array in O(n) time and O(1) space.
The majority element is the element that appears more than n/2 times in the array (where n = array length).

-Idea / Intuition
If an element occurs more than half the time, it will "cancel out" all other elements.
Think of it like a voting system:
The majority element gets more votes than everyone else combined.

By pairing different elements, the majority will survive.

-Steps of the Algorithm
Initialize:
candidate = -1
count = 0

Traverse the array:
If count == 0, set candidate = current element.
If current element == candidate, increase count.
Else decrease count.

At the end → candidate will be the potential majority element.
