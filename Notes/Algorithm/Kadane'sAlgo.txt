-What is Kadane’s Algorithm?
Kadane’s Algorithm is used to find the maximum sum subarray in a given array in O(n) time.

-Problem statement:
Given an integer array (with positive, negative, or zero values), find the contiguous subarray that has the largest sum.

-Why is it needed?
The brute force way would be:
Check all subarrays, calculate their sums → O(n²) or O(n³).
Kadane’s Algorithm reduces it to O(n).

-How it Works (Intuition)
We keep track of two things while scanning the array:
currentSum → maximum sum of the subarray ending at current index.
maxSum → global maximum found so far.

At each step:
Add the current element to currentSum.
If currentSum becomes smaller than the current element itself → restart from current element.
Update maxSum if currentSum is greater.
