The Dutch National Flag Algorithm (DNF) is specifically designed for 3 distinct categories (like 0,1,2 or "red, white, blue").

-Why only 3?
Because the algorithm maintains 3 partitions:
Left side → elements of the first category (e.g., 0s).
Middle → elements being checked (e.g., 1s).
Right side → elements of the last category (e.g., 2s).
This neat separation works beautifully for exactly three groups.

-Rules
At each step, check nums[mid]:
If 0 → swap nums[low] ↔ nums[mid], then low++, mid++.
If 1 → just mid++ (leave it in middle).
If 2 → swap nums[mid] ↔ nums[high], then high-- (don’t move mid yet).
